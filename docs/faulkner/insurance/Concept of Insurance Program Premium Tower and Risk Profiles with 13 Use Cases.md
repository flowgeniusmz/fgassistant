# Concept of Insurance Program Premium "Tower" and Risk Profile

## Goals and Purpose:

**Goals:** The primary goal of an insurance premium tower is to structure a comprehensive insurance program that adequately covers the risk profile of an entity, usually a large corporation or organization, with varying layers of insurance coverage.

**Purpose:** The purpose is to optimize insurance coverage by balancing risk retention and transfer. The tower arrangement helps in managing costs while ensuring that the entity is protected against a wide range of risks.

## Objectives:

1. **Risk Identification:** Understand and categorize the risks faced by the entity.

2. **Risk Quantification:** Assess the potential financial impact of these risks.

3. **Coverage Layering:** Structure insurance layers (primary, excess, umbrella, etc.) based on risk assessment.

4. **Cost Efficiency:** Optimize the cost of insurance across different layers.

5. **Risk Transfer:** Transfer high-severity, low-frequency risks to insurance carriers, while retaining manageable risks.

## Techniques and Calculations/Models:

- **Risk Assessment Models:** These include actuarial models and statistical analyses to quantify risk and predict potential losses.

- **Insurance Valuation Models:** Used for determining the appropriate coverage amounts and premium costs for each layer of the tower.

- **Layered Coverage Approach:** Involves stacking different insurance policies in a hierarchical order, starting from primary coverage to higher levels of excess coverage.

- **Premium Allocation:** Based on the risk profile, premiums are allocated to each layer of the tower. The lower layers (primary insurance) cover frequent, low-severity risks, and higher layers cover less frequent, high-severity risks.

## Example Use Case:

Consider a large manufacturing company with significant property and liability risks. The company's risk management team, along with their insurance broker, decides to structure an insurance tower:

- **Primary Layer:** Covers common risks such as minor workplace accidents or property damages, with a coverage limit of up to $1 million. The company pays a relatively lower premium for this layer due to the high frequency but low severity of claims.

- **Excess Layers:** Above the primary layer, several excess layers are structured. Each layer covers risks beyond the limits of the underlying policy, up to a certain amount. For example, the first excess layer might cover losses from $1 million to $5 million, the second from $5 million to $20 million, and so on.

- **Umbrella Coverage:** On top of the excess layers, an umbrella policy provides additional coverage for a broad range of risks, including those not covered by the underlying policies.

- **Specialized Coverage:** For specific high-risk areas, such as environmental liability or cyber risks, separate coverage layers are added.

- **Risk Profile and Premium Calculation:** The company's risk profile, including historical claims data, industry risks, and asset values, is analyzed to determine the coverage limits and premiums for each layer. Actuarial models are used to predict the likelihood and impact of potential claims.

- **Implementation:** The company implements the insurance tower, ensuring comprehensive coverage across all potential risks. Regular reviews and adjustments are made based on changes in the company's risk profile and market conditions.

In this use case, the insurance program premium tower allows the company to efficiently manage its risks by purchasing insurance coverage tailored to its specific risk profile and financial capacity.
