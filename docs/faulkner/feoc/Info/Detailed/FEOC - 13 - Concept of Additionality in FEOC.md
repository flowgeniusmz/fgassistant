# Concept of Additionality in FEOC

Additionality is a fundamental principle in the FEOC program, ensuring that the emissions reductions achieved are genuine and beyond what would have occurred without the intervention of the program.

## Defining Additionality
- The FEOC program defines additionality as the measure of the reduction in emissions directly attributable to its interventions, beyond any business-as-usual scenarios.
- AI analytics play a crucial role in assessing and establishing the baseline levels of emissions, against which the impact of additionality is measured.

## Verifying Additionality
- IoT devices provide accurate and verifiable data that supports the calculation of additional reductions.
- Power Automate workflows are designed to integrate verification processes, aligning with regulatory standards and methodologies for confirming additionality.

## Impact on Certificate Valuation
- The concept of additionality directly influences the valuation of emissions offset certificates within the FEOC program.
- Certificates representing additional reductions are critically evaluated and marked to ensure transparency and integrity in the market.

This section outlines the significance of the additionality principle in the FEOC program and describes how it is applied and verified within the system to ensure the credibility of emissions offsets.
