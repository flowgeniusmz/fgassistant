The architecture encapsulates the flow from data capture to user interaction, highlighting the importance of each component in the system.


# System Component Diagram

![System Component Diagram](System_Component_Diagram.PNG)

The flowchart outlines the structure of a data processing system, commencing with IoT sensors gathering data. This data traverses through Power Automate to the OpenAI API where it undergoes validation, calculations, and checks. Post-validation, the data is preserved in Supabase and the resulting certificate data is exhibited on Streamlit. The diagram delineates the flow from the initial data collection to the final display of certificate information, with each component depicted within a purple box, highlighting their roles and interconnectivity.


# System Data Flow

![System Data Flow](System_Data_Flow.PNG)

This flowchart maps out the path of data through a system, initiating with data collection by IoT sensors. This data is propelled through Power Automate to the OpenAI API, where it is subject to a series of validation and calculation processes. The refined data is then lodged within a Supabase database. The Streamlit platform takes center stage in displaying the certificate data, offering an interactive interface for data interaction. Each operational step is encased in a purple box, neatly illustrating the system's data flow.


# System Data Management Flow

The flowchart illustrates a system's data management process, starting with data collection from IoT sensors. The data passes through Power Automate to the OpenAI API for processing and is then stored in Supabase. Streamlit fetches the certificate data for display, while the parties involved are associated with the digital certificates, signifying the system's full data lifecycle.


# System Integration Flowchart

This flowchart visualizes the integration of various system components, from IoT sensors collecting emission data to the data presentation in Streamlit. It outlines the data journey through collection, validation, processing with Power Automate and OpenAI, storage in Supabase, and interaction by the purchaser. It also highlights the management actions within the Faulkner Portal, including forward selling and email communications.


# Temporal Spatial

The "Temporal Spatial" diagram outlines a sequence of data management activities across different system components. It starts with IoT sensors gathering data, followed by Power Automate orchestrating data validation and transformation. The OpenAI API performs compliance checks and accuracy assessments on the data. Subsequently, the data is stored in Supabase and used to generate certificates, which are then accessible via a Streamlit application. This allows various parties to interact with the certificates, facilitating transparency and engagement in the data processing lifecycle.


# Universal Connector Data Flow and Processing

The sequence diagram demonstrates the Universal Connector's role in data flow and processing, acting as an intermediary between IoT sensors and AI-driven analysis. IoT sensors emit data, which is ingested by the Universal Connector using various protocols. The AI, potentially powered by OpenAI, interprets the data using natural language processing to ensure completeness and accuracy. After multiple iterations for accuracy verification, the data is logged into a database and provided to the compliance standards API. This detailed flow ensures that data from IoT sensors is accurately processed and analyzed, contributing to a robust and reliable environmental monitoring system.


# User Interaction with Streamlit Dashboard

This flowchart presents the user interaction sequence with a Streamlit dashboard. The user's journey commences with login and progresses to accessing the dashboard, reviewing an EOC summary, and choosing data parameters. Subsequent steps include analyzing data, generating reports, and EOC management tasks like portfolio review and trading. The interaction sequence is rounded off with personal settings adjustments, such as profile updates and notification preferences. The user's navigational path is clearly depicted with color-coded blocks and icons, delineating the comprehensive dashboard engagement experience.
