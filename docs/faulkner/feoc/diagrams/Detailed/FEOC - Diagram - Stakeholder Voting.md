The flowchart depicts the detailed process of stakeholder voting in an environmental offsetting context. It includes various stakeholders such as a "Stakeholder," "Faulkner EOC Platform," "Blockchain Verification," "Carbon Emitter," "Green Project Provider," and "Certificate Purchaser." The process initiates with a project proposal by the stakeholder and traverses through stages of data provision, emissions matching, certificate trading, and finalizes with the updating of certificate status. The systematic flow of actions and verifications emphasizes the role of blockchain in ensuring the integrity and transparency of the carbon offsetting process.
