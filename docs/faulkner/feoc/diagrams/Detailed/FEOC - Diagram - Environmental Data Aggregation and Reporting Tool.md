The flowchart represents the environmental data aggregation and reporting tool utilized within the FEOC program. It begins with the collection of data from various project databases, which is then consolidated, standardized, and merged. Analysis functions are applied to assess performance indicators and trend analysis, leading to customized report generation. These reports, tailored for regulatory compliance and featuring data visualization, can be exported for distribution. This tool underscores the program's commitment to thorough and transparent environmental reporting.
