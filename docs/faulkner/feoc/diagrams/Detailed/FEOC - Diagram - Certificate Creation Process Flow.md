The diagram details the process flow for creating Emission Offset Certificates (EOCs) in the FEOC program. A user initiates the request for certificate creation, which is then processed by the system to generate and issue the certificate. The process includes stages for validation, trade, and updating ownership, all of which are logged and verified. This ensures the integrity and traceability of each certificate from inception to the final user holding, highlighting the program's commitment to transparent and verifiable emissions offsetting.
