This flowchart illustrates the automated regulatory compliance process within the FEOC program. The "Regulatory Body" ensures compliance from "Carbon Emitters," who report their emission data. The "Faulkner EOC Program" aligns these reports with emission reduction projects and provides EOCs (Emission Offset Certificates) accordingly. "Green Project Providers" log data and transactions, while "Certificate Purchasers" buy EOCs and register their ownership. The "Decentralized Ledger Network" offers a transparent platform for all stakeholders to confirm transactions, thereby maintaining the integrity of certificate lineage and ensuring that compliance is met with transparency and accuracy.
