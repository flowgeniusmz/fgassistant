The journey map visualizes the interface for investors to analyze the impact of their investments. It starts with an emission impact analysis, comparing projected versus actual emissions. Investors can then view financial analysis, such as ROI from projects and cost savings. Environmental metrics are presented, including total emissions reduced and equivalent environmental benefits. The interface culminates in report generation, where investors can customize reports with features and criteria to fit their needs, facilitating informed decisions based on comprehensive environmental, financial, and impact data.
