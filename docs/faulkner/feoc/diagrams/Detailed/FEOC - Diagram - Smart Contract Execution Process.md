This flowchart outlines the process of smart contract execution within a digital platform. A stakeholder's request to create a contract kicks off the process, leading to the definition and confirmation of contract terms. Once the terms are set, the smart contract triggers financial transactions, linking to environmental performance metrics. Real-time data is sent to ensure that the smart contract reflects up-to-date conditions. Following the execution of the contract and transactions, the process concludes with a confirmation of transaction completion, marking the end of the contract's lifecycle.
