The flowchart delineates the financial forecasting process within the FEOC program. Starting with various data inputs like capital expenditure, operational costs, and baseline emission levels, the process involves a financial analysis that incorporates external factors such as carbon pricing trends and regulatory incentives. Econometric modeling is applied to develop financial scenarios, providing conservative and optimistic estimates. This aids in presenting stakeholders with confidence intervals and sensitivity analyses, crucial for making informed decisions in the context of environmental financial planning.
