The sequence diagram demonstrates the Universal Connector's role in data flow and processing, acting as an intermediary between IoT sensors and AI-driven analysis. IoT sensors emit data, which is ingested by the Universal Connector using various protocols. The AI, potentially powered by OpenAI, interprets the data using natural language processing to ensure completeness and accuracy. After multiple iterations for accuracy verification, the data is logged into a database and provided to the compliance standards API. This detailed flow ensures that data from IoT sensors is accurately processed and analyzed, contributing to a robust and reliable environmental monitoring system.
