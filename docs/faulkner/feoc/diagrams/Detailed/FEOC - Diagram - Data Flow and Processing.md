The sequence diagram presents a data processing workflow that encompasses the reception and handling of data from IoT sensors, its integration and analysis through AI, and the subsequent display in a user interface. The data journey begins with IoT sensors emitting data under different protocols, which is then directed through Power Automate for an initial check of completeness. OpenAI's capabilities are leveraged for further data analysis, ensuring the data's accuracy and compliance. Finally, the processed data is stored in a Supabase database, ready to be accessed and visualized through a dashboard UI, facilitating user interaction and decision-making.
