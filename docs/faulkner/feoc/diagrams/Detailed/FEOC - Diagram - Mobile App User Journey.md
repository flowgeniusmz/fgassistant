The user journey for the mobile app includes several steps designed to enhance user engagement and functionality. Initially, the user is presented with a secure login screen, leading to a dashboard that aggregates emission stats. Data management features allow for direct data entry and access to detailed emission reports. The app also provides compliance notifications and allows users to set reduction targets and track progress visually. Community interaction is encouraged through features that enable users to access community tools and share goals and achievements, fostering a collaborative environment for emission reduction efforts.
