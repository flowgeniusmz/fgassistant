The diagram illustrates the integration process for IoT sensors and telemetry systems within an environmental monitoring framework. Data from various sensor types, transmitted over MQTT or HTTP protocols, is channeled through existing IoT adapters. This data is then consolidated by an OpenAI integration layer, which structures the data for analysis. The final output is displayed on a Streamlit dashboard, providing users with insights and analytics derived from the raw sensor data. This system exemplifies a streamlined approach to capturing and utilizing sensor data for environmental intelligence and decision-making.
