This sequence diagram illustrates the integration of data from environmental sensors into a centralized system. Sensors transmit raw data, which is then transformed into a standardized format by a data transformer. The transformed data undergoes validation for errors, and once confirmed as accurate, is stored in a secure data storage solution. This flow ensures that environmental data is consistently formatted, accurately recorded, and securely maintained, allowing for reliable monitoring and analysis of environmental conditions.
