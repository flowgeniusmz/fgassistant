This diagram illustrates the sequence of data integration from external environmental sensors into a centralized monitoring system. Environmental sensors transmit raw data, which is then converted into a standardized format by a data transformer. The data validator checks the data for errors, ensuring its reliability before it is stored in a secure cloud-based data storage system. This streamlined process enables accurate and secure data management, which is crucial for monitoring environmental conditions and making data-driven decisions.
