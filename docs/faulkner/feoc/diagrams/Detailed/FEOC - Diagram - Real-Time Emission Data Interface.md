The Real-Time Emission Data Interface is designed to provide users with up-to-the-minute information on emission levels. The main dashboard displays current emission data, with real-time graphs and gauges for detailed analysis. Historical data comparison tools and color-coded alerts for regulatory limits offer a comprehensive overview of emissions over time. Users can set custom alarms and indicate their notification preferences, ensuring they are promptly informed about threshold exceedances or significant changes. This interface serves as an essential tool for users to monitor and respond to environmental data effectively.
