This diagram illustrates the ecosystem interactions within an environmental offset platform. It shows various entities such as Emitters, Providers, Purchasers, and EndCustomers engaging in activities like investment, solution provision, product purchasing, and green product consumption. The central focus is the FaulknerEmissionOffsetCertificate, which ties together data management and UI interactions through the FaulknerManagementPortal, Supabase storage, and Streamlit interface. IoT Sensors play a crucial role in providing real-time emission data to the system.
