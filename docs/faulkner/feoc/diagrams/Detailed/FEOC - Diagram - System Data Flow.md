This flowchart maps out the path of data through a system, initiating with data collection by IoT sensors. This data is propelled through Power Automate to the OpenAI API, where it is subject to a series of validation and calculation processes. The refined data is then lodged within a Supabase database. The Streamlit platform takes center stage in displaying the certificate data, offering an interactive interface for data interaction. Each operational step is encased in a purple box, neatly illustrating the system's data flow.
