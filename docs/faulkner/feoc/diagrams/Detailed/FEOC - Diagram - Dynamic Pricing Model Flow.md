This flowchart demonstrates the dynamic pricing model used within the FEOC program. It begins with data inputs that include market demand, supply availability, historical prices, and predictive market trends. The data undergoes analysis and is integrated with economic theories for real-time adjustments. Dynamic pricing logic takes into account liquidity factors, news events, and investor sentiment to calculate prices. The output interface then displays current prices, historical charts, and alerts for stakeholder interaction, enabling informed decision-making based on the latest market data.
