This diagram illustrates a system architecture that connects IoT sensors and telemetry systems with various data protocols, including MQTT and HTTP. The data is unified, then integrated and processed via OpenAI technology. The Blockchain component ensures transparency, while the Real-time Electronic Contracting system verifies transactions. Both these elements feed into a Streamlit Dashboard for data visualization. The architecture encapsulates the flow from data capture to user interaction, highlighting the importance of each component in the system.
