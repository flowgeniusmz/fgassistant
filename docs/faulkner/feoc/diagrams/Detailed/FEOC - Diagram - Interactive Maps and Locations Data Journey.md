This journey map outlines the user interaction with an interactive map interface, designed to provide a comprehensive view of projects and their impact. Users can zoom in and out, select regions, and view project markers to engage with the map. Clicking on a marker displays a project summary and key metrics, allowing users to access detailed reports and apply various filters, such as project type or certification standards. The map dynamically integrates real-time project updates, offering users an up-to-date and interactive experience for exploring environmental projects and their specifics.
