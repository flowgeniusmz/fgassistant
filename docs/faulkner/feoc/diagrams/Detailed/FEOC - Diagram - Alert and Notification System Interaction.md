The sequence diagram outlines the interaction between stakeholders and an alert and notification system. Initially, a notification is triggered, prompting the stakeholder to acknowledge receipt. The system then enters a loop where it checks for specific triggers and sends regular updates. Optionally, the user can customize preferences for alerts. In the case of an urgent trigger, the system sends an immediate alert and the stakeholder performs an urgent action. For non-urgent triggers, scheduled alerts are sent. This diagram illustrates the system's ability to communicate proactively with stakeholders, ensuring they are informed and can take timely action.
