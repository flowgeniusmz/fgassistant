This diagram represents the access control hierarchy within a system. It shows a top-down approach where the System Administrator has full control over the system. They define the Permissions Matrix, which specifies the accessibility levels for different roles. The Role Assignment Process is central to defining what each role can and cannot do. The General User has limited access, determined by the permissions granted, and the Auditor has read-only access, ensuring they can review but not alter data. Security Checks are in place to prevent unauthorized actions, maintaining system integrity.
