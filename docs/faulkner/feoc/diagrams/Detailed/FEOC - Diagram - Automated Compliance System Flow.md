This flowchart illustrates the automated compliance system within the FEOC framework. It starts with various data input streams such as emission levels, operational data, and regulatory requirements that feed into a data processing unit. The subsequent decision-making process evaluates compliance and generates a report. If the entity is in compliance, the report confirms this status; if non-compliance is identified, the report details areas requiring attention. This system ensures that compliance is maintained across all operations within the FEOC program, facilitating a responsive and accountable environmental impact strategy.
