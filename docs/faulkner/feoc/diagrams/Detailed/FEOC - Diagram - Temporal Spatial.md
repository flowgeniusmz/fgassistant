The "Temporal Spatial" diagram outlines a sequence of data management activities across different system components. It starts with IoT sensors gathering data, followed by Power Automate orchestrating data validation and transformation. The OpenAI API performs compliance checks and accuracy assessments on the data. Subsequently, the data is stored in Supabase and used to generate certificates, which are then accessible via a Streamlit application. This allows various parties to interact with the certificates, facilitating transparency and engagement in the data processing lifecycle.
