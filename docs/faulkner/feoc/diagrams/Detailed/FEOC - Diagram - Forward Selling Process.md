The diagram outlines the forward selling process as it pertains to Emission Offset Certificates (EOCs). It shows the EOC seller listing certificates for sale on a trading platform. The compliance validator then checks for compliance before a purchase request is submitted. Once compliance is verified, the transaction continues with the EOC buyer confirming the purchase and the decentralized ledger recording the transaction. This ensures transparency and integrity in the forward selling process, with the EOCs becoming active under new ownership after the sale completion is duly notified and logged.
