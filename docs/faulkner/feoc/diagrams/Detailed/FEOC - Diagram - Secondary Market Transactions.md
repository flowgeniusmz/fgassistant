The diagram visualizes the transaction flow within a secondary market for trading Emission Offset Certificates (EOCs). The process involves a carbon emitter, an EOC provider, and an EOC purchaser. The EOC provider offers certificates for sale, which are then selected and validated by the purchaser through compliance checks. Upon passing compliance, the transaction is confirmed, recorded, and the ownership is updated. This flow ensures a transparent and compliant trading environment, enabling participants to engage in the buying and selling of EOCs within a regulated secondary market.
