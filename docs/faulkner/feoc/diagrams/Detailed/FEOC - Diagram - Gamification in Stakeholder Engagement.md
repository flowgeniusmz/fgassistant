The sequence diagram showcases a gamification strategy to bolster stakeholder engagement within the Faulkner EOC Program Platform. Participants in the program are tracked for their activities and achievements. Rewards are assigned based on these metrics, which in turn influence further engagement. The platform adapts to levels of stakeholder activity by assigning higher rewards for high engagement, standard rewards for moderate engagement, and minimal rewards for low engagement. This system encourages competition and collaboration, with the platform's gamification features enhancing the overall user experience and fostering a more active and committed community.
