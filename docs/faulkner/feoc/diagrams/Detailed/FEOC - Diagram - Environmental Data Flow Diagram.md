This diagram illustrates the flow of environmental data through different system components. The process begins with Emitters and Providers inputting data, which is then managed through data collection, validation, and processing. The Faulkner Emission Offset Certificate is central, linking the management and oversight through the Faulkner Management Portal with data storage in Supabase and front-end interactions via Streamlit.
