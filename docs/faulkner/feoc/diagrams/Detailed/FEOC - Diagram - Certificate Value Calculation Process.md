The sequence diagram depicts the analytical process for calculating the value of an EOC. It begins with a 'Data Collector' role, responsible for gathering emission data. This data is analyzed by the 'Market Analyst', who considers various market factors including supply, demand, and historical prices, and uses this information to predict future trends. The 'Value Calculator' then assesses this information to determine the monetary value of the certificates, culminating in the establishment of the EOC for transaction purposes. This calculated value plays a pivotal role in the trading and valuation of EOCs on the market.
