This diagram outlines the process flow for a potential participant's inquiry and subsequent environmental data submission. The 'Potential Participant' initiates an inquiry to the 'Inquiry System', which acknowledges and guides them to submit environmental data via a 'Data Submission Portal'. The data is then sent for verification to a 'Verification Service', ensuring its accuracy before being managed and reviewed by the participant. Upon successful verification, the 'Digital Platform' grants access to the participant, completing the onboarding workflow.
