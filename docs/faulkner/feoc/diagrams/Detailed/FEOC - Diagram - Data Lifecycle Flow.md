This flowchart represents the lifecycle of data within a system, starting with the collection by IoT sensors. The data is then managed by Power Automate and transformed through the OpenAI API, undergoing validation and compliance checks. Once processed, it's stored in Supabase and utilized in a Streamlit-hosted certificate application, enabling interaction with the certificates by various parties such as Emitters, Providers, and Purchasers.
