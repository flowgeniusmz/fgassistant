The diagram presents the lifecycle of an Emission Offset Certificate (EOC) within the FEOC program. The process begins with the initiation of an EOC, including project assessment and stakeholder agreement. It progresses through monitoring and data collection, data verification, and performance evaluation stages. Financial transactions, trading, and market interactions are crucial phases that follow, leading up to the project's conclusion. The lifecycle ends with the certificate's closure and archiving, marking the completion of its journey and ensuring proper documentation and compliance throughout the EOC's lifespan.
