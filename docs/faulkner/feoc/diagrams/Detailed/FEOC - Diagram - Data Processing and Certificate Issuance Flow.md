This flowchart details a data processing sequence beginning with IoT sensors sending data to Power Automate. Following the data transfer, the OpenAI API performs validation, calculations, and checks. The processed data is then stored in Supabase, and certificate data is finally displayed on Streamlit for interaction, completing the flow from data collection to certificate issuance.
