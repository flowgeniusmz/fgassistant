This sequence diagram outlines the steps involved in determining the value of an EOC. The process starts with a "Data Collector" who gathers emission data. This data is analyzed by a "Market Analyst," taking into account supply, demand, and historical pricing, to predict future market trends. The "Value Calculator" then uses this analysis to calculate the monetary value of the EOCs, establishing their price for transactions. This systematic approach to valuation ensures that EOCs are priced according to accurate and current market data, providing a reliable framework for stakeholders in the carbon credit market.
