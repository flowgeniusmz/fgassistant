The diagram displays a streamlined workflow for managing data within an environmental monitoring system. It starts with inputs from IoT sensors, Emitters, and Providers, leading to data collection. The data then goes through a process of validation and processing. Once processed, it is stored in Supabase and finally presented in Streamlit for user interaction. Additionally, the diagram includes the management and actions taken within the Faulkner Portal, encapsulating the end-to-end process.
