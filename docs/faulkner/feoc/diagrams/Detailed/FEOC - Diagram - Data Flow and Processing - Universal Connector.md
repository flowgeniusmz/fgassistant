This sequence diagram demonstrates the data processing workflow facilitated by a universal connector, which harmonizes various data streams for AI-driven analysis. IoT sensors dispatch data, subsequently funneled through the connector. The AI, likely incorporating OpenAI technology, interprets and processes this data, iterating to ensure precision. Subsequently, the processed data is channeled into a database, interfaced with compliance standards APIs, and furnished for user access. This systematic data handling ensures a meticulous approach to environmental data processing, crucial for accurate monitoring and compliance verification.
