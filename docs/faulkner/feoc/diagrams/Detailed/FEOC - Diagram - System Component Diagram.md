The flowchart outlines the structure of a data processing system, commencing with IoT sensors gathering data. This data traverses through Power Automate to the OpenAI API where it undergoes validation, calculations, and checks. Post-validation, the data is preserved in Supabase and the resulting certificate data is exhibited on Streamlit. The diagram delineates the flow from the initial data collection to the final display of certificate information, with each component depicted within a purple box, highlighting their roles and interconnectivity.
