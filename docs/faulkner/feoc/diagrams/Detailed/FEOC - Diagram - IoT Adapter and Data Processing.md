The diagram details the data flow from IoT sensors through various adapters and integrations to the end user. IoT sensors emit data, which is collected by different adapters depending on the protocol used: MQTT or HTTP. The collected data is then integrated with OpenAI's system for processing, leading to structured data. This structured data is presented through a Streamlit dashboard, offering insights and analytics to the user. It highlights the versatility of data integration from diverse IoT sources and the utilization of AI for data analysis, enhancing the decision-making process in environmental monitoring and other applications.
