This sequence diagram depicts the certificate issuance and verification process that mimics blockchain technology. A certificate issuer issues a certificate that is recorded in a decentralized ledger, ensuring the transaction is immutable. Certificate stakeholders can request verification, where the authenticity and ownership history are checked to confirm security and provide transparency. This process ensures trustworthiness and reliability in the certificate's lifecycle, echoing blockchain's principles of decentralization and security without actually utilizing blockchain technology.
